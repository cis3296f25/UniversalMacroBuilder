# Universal Macro Builder

This project aims to automate repetitive, often mundane, tasks. It can be used for farming in video games, automatically adding text, repeating nagivational steps for a pesky application, anything that can be time consuming and cumbersome.The Universal Macro Builder captures keyboard and mouse interactions on the user's system. Once the user is satisifed with what they want captured, the Universal Macro Builder will replay the user's actions. There can be multiple saved macros that the user can select from at any given time, allowing users to have a repertoire of macros for future use if need be.

Adding an screenshot or a mockup of your application in action would be nice.
